## Description
This web application acts as an unofficial extension for the Steam client. Steam is a platform that connects game developers to gamers by offering a digital marketplace for video games. It also has has achievements for each game.

Our app utilizes the Steam API to build upon the existing features within Steam. This will be done by linking a user’s Steam ID (their account for Steam) to their login for our application. This will allow for an updated list of their purchased games to be usable. We implemented features where a user can pick a random achievement to play from all their owned games or pick a random achievement to play from a single game, and where a user can see all of their completed achievements and have the option to leave a feedback on that achievement.

For this project, we used Steam's API and Tailwind CSS for styling.
